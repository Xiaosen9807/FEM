This is a Python implementation of few FEM codes. It closely follows the book
of Anastasis C. Polycarpou "Introduction to the Finite Element Method in
Electromagnetics" (doi:10.2200/S00019ED1V01Y200604CEM004)

"The main concept of the finite element method is based on subdividing the
geometrical domain of a boundary-value problem into smaller subdomains, 
called the finite elements, and expressing the governing differential 
equation along with the associated boundary conditions as a set of linear 
equations that can be solved computationally using linear algebra techniques."

For more details on FEM you can visit the tutorial of
[Deal II](https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html) -
a C++ FEM library. They had published [50+ video lectures](http://www.math.tamu.edu/~bangerth/videos.html) on FEM and
the Deal II library.
